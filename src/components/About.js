            Hi ! I'm Catherine üñê,
          </p>
          <p className="pb-5">
             From Industrial Design to UX, my journey has been diverse. With a Bachelor of Arts in Industrial Design, 
             I honed my creative skills. A UX design certificate introduced me to the tech industry. 
             Following a UX research internship, I realized the importance of not only intuitive interfaces but also building them.
             This led me to a Software Engineering program where I've mastered key languages like JavaScript, HTML5, React, Node.js, and Bootstrap. 
             Now, my focus is on becoming a strong web developer and crafting exceptional user experiences with a team. 
          </p>

          <p>I'm familiar with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for backend development.</p>
